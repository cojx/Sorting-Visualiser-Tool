This project was inspired by Clement Mihailescu's Sorting Visualizer project:

I found this project interesting and wanted to make one of my own. Moreover, it allows me to gain a better understanding about sorting algorithms. Building this app also allowed me to greatly improve my Javascript, HTML and CSS skills.
